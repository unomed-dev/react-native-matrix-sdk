## Installation

### Installation into your own project

This package is available in the [npm registry].

```sh
npm i @unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk
yarn add @unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk
```


### Installation from local checkout

Clone the repository into a sibling folder of your app and then install the package using
a relative path.

```sh
npm add ../react-native-matrix-sdk
```

You might have to run `yarn prepare` in case it's not executed by default. Additionally you
need to change `metro.config.js` to find and watch the module's source code.

```js
const config = {
  resolver: {
    extraNodeModules: {
      'react-native-matrix-sdk': path.resolve(__dirname, '../react-native-matrix-sdk'),
    }, ...
  },
  watchFolders: [
    path.resolve(__dirname, '../react-native-matrix-sdk'), ...
  ]
};
```

On the first build or any time you update the version of matrix-rust-sdk, you'll have
to rebuild the Rust code and regenerate the module with

```sh
yarn generate
```


## Usage

See [src/index.ts] for the module's full API. You may also find a usage example
in [example/src/App.tsx].
